Create Server by starting SVClient with one port parameter, example: "java SVClient 4444"

Connect with client by starting SVClient with two parameters, hostname and port, example "java SVClient 127.0.0.1 4444"

After connecting you'll be prompted to enter the ship positions in the form of "left xy coordinates to right xy coordinates". Example: "15 to 55" would place your 5 square Ship from 15 to 55.

After placing all your Ships you'll have to enter the coordinates you want to shoot in the form of "x y".
